      <h2>Architectural Control Committee (ACC) Requests</h2>
      <p>Examples of projects that require approval per the CCRs are listed below. If you have any
      questions about whether or not a project requires approval, please contact a Board member or
      send email <a href="mailto:qchoaboard@outlook.com">qchoaboard@outlook.com</a>. Examples of
      (but not limited to) projects requiring approval:

      <ul>
        <li>House Painting
        <li>Fences or walls
        <li>Tree removal
        <li>New Roof
        <li>Mass landscaping projects or redesign
        <li>Any additions or architectural changes to the exterior of the house
        <li>Sheds or other free standing structures such as playgrounds and dog runs
        <li>Hot tubs and spas
        <li>Air condition units or other equipment visible from the street
        <li>Any project which may involve the knowledge of, or compliance with King County Codes
      </ul>

      <p>It is the responsibility of the homeowner to obtain the necessary information and/or
      approval from the county for any project that must comply with King County Codes before
      submission of the project to the ACC.

      <p>All applications and county approval must be submitted in writing to the ACC for approval
      to the <a href="contact.html#board-mailing-address">board mailing address</a> or
      <a href="contact.html#board-email-address">QC official email</a>.

      <p>The ACC may solicit feedback from neighbors so we recommend that you speak with your
      neighbors regarding the project.
