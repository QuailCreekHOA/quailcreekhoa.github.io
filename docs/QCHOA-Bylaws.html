<p id="3.7"> 3.7 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Board Actions Without Meetings.</span>
    Any action under any provision of
    these Bylaws which may be taken at a meeting of the Board, may be taken

    a part of the Association records.


<p id="3.8"> 3.8 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Removal of Directors.</span>
    The Owners, by a majority vote, and at a
