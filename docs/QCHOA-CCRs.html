    the Committee shall find:

    <div class="indent"> <p> (a) The approval of the plan is in the best interest of the Owner and
    consistent with this Declaration.

    <p> (b) General architectural considerations, including relationship and layout of structures to
    natural features and adjacent homes, orientation, footprint and location of buildings,
    maintenance of view corridors and natural sight lines, vehicular access, circulation and
    parking, setbacks, height, grades, walls, fences, and similar elements have been designed to be
    compatible with the overall design and concept of Quail Creek.

    coverage of plant materials, provisions for irrigation, drainage, maintenance and protection of
    existing landscaped areas and similar elements have been considered to ensure visual relief, to
    complement buildings and structures, and to provide an attractive environment for the enjoyment
    of the Owners in general and the enhancement of the property values in Quail Creek.

    <p> (e) Each single family residence shall contain a minimum of 1,800 square feet for one story
    and 2,200 square feet for two stories exclusive of open decks (covered or uncovered), garages,

    fails to respond to an applicant’s complete and properly submitted application within thirty
    (30) days after the Committee has notified the applicant that the application is complete,
    formal written approval will not be required, and the applicant shall be deemed to have fully
    complied with the provisions for approval.

    <p id="2.7.4"> 2.7.4 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Committee Obligation.</span> In its
    deliberations and in the discharge of its obligations hereunder, the Committee shall act

<h2 id="3">ARTICLE 3.  ASSOCIATION BUDGET, ASSESSMENTS, AND LIENS</h2>

    <p id="3.1"> Section 3.1 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Owner’s Covenants to Pay
    Assessments.</span> By acquisition or transfer of any ownership interest in a Lot, the Owner
    thereof covenants and agrees thereby, on behalf of himself and his heirs, successors, and
    assigns, to pay the Association, in advance, all general and specific assessments levied as
    provided herein.

    <p id="3.2"> Section 3.2 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Association Budget.</span> The Association
    shall prepare, or cause the preparation of, an operating budget for the Association at least
    annually, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The operating budget
    shall set forth all sums required by the Association, as estimated by the Association, to meet
    its annual costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, all management and administration
    costs, operating, maintenance, upkeep and repair expenses of the Common Areas, and services
    furnished to or in connection with the Common Areas, including the amount of all taxes and
    assessments levied against, and the cost of liability and other insurance on the Common Areas,
    and including charges for any services furnished by or to the Association; the cost of utilities
    and other services; and the cost of funding all reserves established by the Association. The
    funds required to meet the Association’s annual expenses shall be raised from a general
    assessment against each Owner as provided hereafter. The Association may revise the operating
    budget after its preparation, as it deems necessary or advisable in order to take into account
    and defray additional costs and expenses of the Association.

    <p id="3.3"> Section 3.3 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Levy of General Assessment.</span> In
    order to meet the costs and expenses projected in its operating budget, the Association shall by
    Association Action determine and levy in advance on every Owner a general assessment. The amount
    of each Owner’s general assessment shall be one fortieth (1/40th) of the amount of the
    Association’s operating budget for each Lot owned. The Association shall make reasonable efforts
    to determine the amount of the general assessment payable by each Owner for an assessment period
    at least thirty (30) days in advance of the beginning of such period and shall at that time
    prepare a roster of the Owners and the general assessment allocated to each, which shall be open
    to inspection by any Owner upon reasonable notice to the Association. Notice of the general
    assessment shall thereupon be sent to each Owner provided, however, that notification to an
    Owner of the amount of an assessment shall not be necessary to the validity thereof. The
    omission by the Association, before the expiration of any assessment period, to fix the amount
    of the general assessment hereunder for that or the next period, shall not be deemed a waiver or
    modification in any respect of the provisions of this Article or a release of any Owner from the
    obligation to pay the general assessment, or any installment thereof, for that or any subsequent
    assessment period, but the general assessment fixed for the preceding period shall continue
    until a new assessment is fixed. Upon any revision by the Association of the operating budget
    during the assessment period for which such budget was prepared, the Association shall, if
    necessary, revise the general assessment levied against Owners and give notice to each Owner.

    <p id="3.4"> Section 3.4 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Payment of General Assessment.</span> Upon
    Association Action, installments of general assessments may be collected on a monthly,
    quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis. Any Owner may prepay one or more installments on any
    assessment levied by the Association without penalty.

    <p id="3.5"> Section 3.5 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Nondiscriminatory Assessment.</span> No
    assessment shall be made at any time which may unreasonably discriminate against any particular
    Owner or group of Owners in favor of other Owners. However, a special assessment may be made
    against a particular Owner by a two-thirds majority vote of the Board if, after notice from the
    Association of failure to maintain such Lot in a condition comparable to the other Lots has been
    given, the Association elects to expend funds to bring such Owner’s Lot up to such comparable
    standard.

    <p id="3.6"> Section 3.6 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Commencement of Assessments.</span>
    Liability of an Owner for assessments shall commence on the first day of the month following the
    date upon which any instrument of transfer to such Owner becomes operative (such as the date of
    a deed or the date of a recorded real estate contract for the sale of any Lot or, if earlier,
    the first day of the calendar month following Owner’s occupancy of such Lot); provided, however,
    that the first month’s assessment shall be payable at the closing of the sale of a Lot; provided
    further, however, that a Participating Builder shall not be liable for any assessments with
    respect to a Lot acquired from Declarant for a period of one year from the date of acquisition.
    The Declarant, its successors and assigns shall not be liable for any assessments with respect
    to any Lot unless such Lot is improved with a structure.

    <p id="3.7"> Section 3.7 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Certificates of Assessment Payment.</span>
    Upon request, the Board shall furnish written certificates certifying the extent to which
    assessment payments on a specified Lot are paid and current to the date stated therein. A
    reasonable charge may be made by the Association for the issuance of such certificate.

    <p id="3.8"> Section 3.8 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Special Assessments.</span> In addition to
    the general assessments authorized by this Article, the Association may, by Association Action,
    levy a special assessment or assessments at any time, applicable to that year only, for the
    purpose of defraying, in whole or in part, the cost of any construction or reconstruction,
    inordinate repair, or replacement of a capital improvement owned or maintained by the
    Association including the entry way sign and landscaping and/or fixtures and personal property
    related thereto, for the purpose of setting aside adequate reserves, or for such other purpose
    as the Association may consider appropriate; provided, however, that any such special assessment
    in excess of $250.00 per lot must be approved with the vote of two-thirds of the Owners. The
    due dates of any special assessment payments shall be fixed by the Association Action
    authorizing such special assessment.

    <p id="3.9"> Section 3.9 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Effect of Nonpayment of Assessment.</span>
    If any assessment payment is not made in full within thirty (30) days after it was first due and
    payable, the unpaid amounts shall constitute a lien against the Lot assessed and shall bear
    interest from such due date at a rate set by the Board in its rules and regulations which shall
    not exceed the highest rate then permitted by law. By acceptance of a deed to a Lot, recording
    of a real estate contract therefor, or any other means of acquisition of an ownership interest,
    and whether or not it shall be so expressed in any such deed or other instrument, each Owner
    shall be deemed to grant thereby to the Association, its agents and employees, and to Declarant
    during the Development Period, the right and power to bring all actions against such Owner
    personally for the collection of such assessments as a debt, and to enforce the liens created by
    this Declaration in favor of the Association by foreclosure of the continuing liens in the same
    form of action as is then provided for the foreclosure of a mortgage on real property. The liens
    provided for in this Declaration shall be for the benefit of the Association, and shall arise in
    accordance with the terms of this Declaration without the necessity of any further action by the
    Association. Association shall have the power to bid at any lien foreclosure sale and to
    acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, and convey the Lot foreclosed against.

    <p id="3.10"> Section 3.10 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Duration of Lien.</span> Any lien
    arising pursuant to <a href="#3.9">Section 3.9</a> shall be a continuing lien in the amount
    stated in the assessment from the time of the assessment, but expiring pro rata as the
    assessment payments are made, and shall also be the personal obligation of the person or entity
    who is the Owner of the Lot at the time of the assessment.

    <p id="3.11"> Section 3.11 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Suspension for Nonpayment of
    Assessment.</span> If an Owner shall be in arrears in the payment of any assessment due, or
    shall otherwise be in default of the performance of any terms of the Governing Documents of the
    Association for a period of 30 days, without the necessity of any further action by the
    Association, said Owner’s voting rights shall be suspended (except as against foreclosing
    secured parties) and shall remain suspended until all payments, including interest thereon, are
    brought current and any other default is remedied. No Owner is relieved of liability for
    assessments by nonuse of the Common Areas or by abandonment of a Lot.

    <p id="3.12"> Section 3.12 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Certain Areas Exempt.</span> The tracts,
    rights of way and all portions of Quail Creek dedicated to and accepted by King County or other
    public authority shall be exempt from assessments by the Association unless and until such
    tracts, rights of way, and other dedicated portion of Quail Creek become Common Areas, if ever.



<h2 id="4">ARTICLE 4.  SUBORDINATION OF LIENS</h2>

    <p id="4.1"> Section 4.1 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Intent of Provisions.</span> The
    provisions of this Article 4 apply for the benefit of each Mortgagee who lends money for
    purposes of construction or to secure the payment of purchase price of a Lot.

    <p id="4.2"> Section 4.2 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Mortgagee’s Nonliability.</span> The
    holder of a Mortgage shall not, by reason of its security interest only, be liable for the
    payment of any assessment or charge, nor for the observance or performance of any covenant or
    restriction, excepting only those enforceable by equitable relief and not requiring the payment
    of money, and except as hereafter provided.

    <p id="4.3"> Section 4.3 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Mortgagee’s Rights During
    Foreclosure.</span> During foreclosure of a Mortgage, including any period of redemption, the
    holder of the Mortgage may exercise any or all of the rights and privileges of the Owner of the
    encumbered Lot, including but not limited to the right to vote in the Association to the
    exclusion of the Owner’s exercise of such rights and privileges.

    <p id="4.4"> Section 4.4 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Mortgagee as Owner.</span> At such time as
    a Mortgagee shall become the record Owner of the Lot previously encumbered by the Mortgage, the
    Mortgagee shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Declaration, including the
    obligation to pay for all assessments and charges in the same manner as any Owner.

    <p id="4.5"> Section 4.5 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Mortgagee’s Title Free and Clear of
    Liens.</span> A Mortgagee or other secured party acquiring title to a Lot through foreclosure,
    deed in lieu of foreclosure, or equivalent method, shall acquire title to the encumbered Lot
    free and clear of any lien authorized by or arising out of the provisions of this Declaration,
    insofar as such lien secures the payment of any assessment due but unpaid before the final
    conclusion of any such proceeding, including the expiration date of any period of redemption.
    The Association may treat any unpaid assessments against a Lot foreclosed against as an expense
    of the Association pursuant to <a href="#3.2">Section 3.2</a>.

    <p id="4.6"> Section 4.6 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Survival of Assessment Obligation.</span>
    After the foreclosure of a security interest in a Lot, any unpaid assessments shall continue to
    exist and remain as a personal obligation of the Owner against whom the same was levied, and the
    Association shall use reasonable efforts to collect the same from such Owner.

    <p id="4.7"> Section 4.7 &nbsp; <span class="caption">Subordination of Assessment Liens.</span>
    The liens for assessments provided for in this Declaration shall be subordinate to the lien of
    any first Mortgage or other security interest placed upon a Lot as a construction loan security
    interest or as a purchase price security interest, and, upon demand, the Association will
    execute a written subordination document to confirm such priority. The sale or transfer of any
    Lot or of any interest therein shall not affect the liens provided for in this Declaration
    except as otherwise specifically provided for herein, and in the case of a transfer of a Lot for
    purposes of realizing a security interest, liens shall arise against the Lot for any assessment
    payments coming due after the date of completion of foreclosure.



<h2 id="5">ARTICLE 5.  USE COVENANTS, CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS</h2>
