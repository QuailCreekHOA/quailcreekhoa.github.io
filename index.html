      <h2>Quail Creek Homeowners' Annual Meeting — December 2</h2>

      <p>As the Holiday Season approaches, it reminds us to take time to gather amongst friends and reflect on the year.
      It also signals the time for our neighborhood to meet and discuss new plans for our QCHOA. Please plan to attend
      the Annual Homeowners meeting on Sunday, December 2, 4:30 pm – 6:00 pm at Steve and Lori Hollasch's home:
      <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/27928+NE+Quail+Creek+Dr,+Redmond,+WA+98053/@47.6308376,-121.9678637,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5490715ca5932187:0x34770bd352e5effa!8m2!3d47.630834!4d-121.965675">
      27928 NE Quail Creek Drive</a>. At this meeting, we will provide a recap of this year’s activities, budget and
      issues, as well as outline the plans for 2019.
       
      <p>More significantly, we will be voting on a new board of directors consisting of all new members. The current
      board members have completed their terms and will be resigning effective January 1, 2019.
       
      <p>Please consider volunteering for a board position and taking an active role in shaping our community. The QCHOA
      Board of Directors handles homeowner’s requests and plans activities dedicated to preserving homeowner value and
      maintaining the beauty of our special neighborhood. They also manage the finances and maintenance of the front
      entrance. So whether you are interested in preserving the current image and street appeal of our community, or
      steering it in a new direction, don’t stand on the sidelines — get involved and make a difference.
       
      <p>Since all three existing board members are stepping down, we are looking to fill the positions of President,
      Secretary and Treasurer. If you are interested in any of the open positions, simply reply to this email, or
      contact Steve Hollasch at <a href="mailto:steve@hollasch.net">steve@hollasch.net</a> or Erik Ploof at
      <a href="mailto:eploof@tablesafe.com">eploof@tablesafe.com</a>.
       
      <p>Remember to mark your calendars for the Annual Meeting on December 2nd — we look forward to seeing you!
       
      <p>—<br>
